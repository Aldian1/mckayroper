## 3× All-Nighters  

Last week I found myself in the office both days of the weekend. A client project had to be delivered without fail. It’s part of the sacrifices of running a fast-scaling agency.  

I then thought it would be clever to work evenings every day of the week up until Wednesday. At that point, my body said *no more* and rewarded me with a head cold. Sitting on my sofa, I started thinking about longevity—which led me to write this post.  

## Longevity  

I first learned about [Bryan Johnson](https://www.bryanjohnson.com/) and longevity when he had a much smaller community. Before he commercialized the Blueprint protocol, he was posting small YouTube videos on his studies.  

What struck me was that, just like me, others wanted to explore the idea of extending life. It wasn’t something people talked about much at the time.  

That being said, he had some cool ideas:  

- Don’t consume food that kills you.  
- Exercise your knees and joints.  
- Dancing kills depression.  
- Life can be extended, if you want it to be.  

Bryan’s insights pointed to the idea that life doesn’t have to be short—and that there’s a great deal more we could be doing to help our bodies out. Admittedly, I don’t follow many of these yet (lol).  

## Applying It to My Life  

What I realized this week from several late nights is that looking after myself is key. I can’t be a world-class programmer, CEO, or YouTuber if I don’t have the physical energy to sustain it.  

This cold, for example, could probably have been avoided if I were in better shape.  

So I’ve got a few things up my sleeve that I’ll try this month and report back on. I highly recommend them:  

1. Portable sauna tent. Best $500 I’ve ever spent—sweating it out feels purifying.  
2. Gym in your apartment building. Just roll out of bed and go.  
3. Removing anything from your apartment that isn’t helping you.  
4. Hydrating, meditating, and recognizing when you need a break.  
5. Blocking breaks into your day and being intentional with your time.  

The main thing is just having a plan and committing to it.  

Ciao!
