## 7-8 years of meditating

I honestly can't tell you when I first started sitting. It was on the advice of my younger brother though, that caused me to pick up the meditation app by Sam Harris. 

A daily practice of 10 - 20 minutes with Sam teaching you basic techniques. What started as a way for me to escape stress and anxiety soon became more than I ever thought it would be, a way of life.

You see in the books Ive read, meditation isn't this form of gaining something as most online gurus will tell you. Theres nothing to unlock and theres nothing to win at by meditation. We simply sit, upright, heart to the sky with no pre-contemptions of what our practice should be.

To gain something from meditation is to have failed at the very act itself, to just sit and be still with ones thoughts is the true objective. 

## How its helped me

I can't say if meditation has had little or large impact in my life. I do know that I am more aware of most things than normal people... but again this is the notion that I gained something from meditaiton. In fact its just sort of helped me learn more about my ownself I guess and what thats like to be someone who sits daily. 

My life is no richer, nor poorer for meditation but I do feel a deep sense of relief and quiteness should I focus on my breath in a moment of chaos. Running a team of 17 has many of those moments as I am sure you can imagine. 

## How

When it comes to my practice its often sporadic, intense, and lightweight all at the same time. I will go days without meditating only to return and do it 2-3 times a day in some instances, hours if I'm feeling especially excited. 

My thoughts are always on my posture, sitting cross legged, chest and head to the sky, trying to reach a meditative state. 

What thoughts do come, I let go rather quickly... and proper practice preaches that should you have thoughts in your head, to simply return to focusing to the breath and allow it to fill your thoughts. 

## When

When I return to my meditation im always at loss as to how I havent done for so long. The relief, despite brief, break from my thoughts is both europhic and clearing. I can think so much better about decisions I need to make after having sat for 10-20 minutes. Thats all it takes ! You can set a timer on your phone for 5 minutes everday and find that piece of the world where you truly feel at one with yourself.
