## 3 Months on the road

Ive been giving talks at Babson College, Mexico & Colombia these past few weeks. Sharing what I know on Lovable and vibe coding in general. What it takes to launch a business and start making impact today not tomorrow. 

## Elite Level College

I was surprised to find that Google lists Babson as the #2 college in the USA. Yet all of its students still seem none the wiser to the coding revolution we are slowly going through.

In 45 minutes I showed them how to make an application with payments and login. Something that would have taken a team 3 days to do in the past. Now its about 15 prompts.

The applications of this are phenomenal. As I was trying to explain to class that day, building something fast and pivoting fast is more possible than ever. You dont need a super technical co-founder to achieve it. You can build the MVP yourself.

## Whiteboard it and it will be built

Students suprised me today. Instead of building they were spending the first 2-3 hours talking about the idea. Talking != action, momentum and so many more wonderful things that come from just building.

The process we take clients through at Imaginary Space is two fold:

1. Identify everything on the whiteboard. Features, problems and things were gonna solve. 

2. Decide there and then on what were gonna build. 

In 60 - 90 minutes we have a map of everything we need. The learnings then come from the building. Maybe a flow wasnt exactly what we wanted... or the UX isnt as tight as we need it to be. Instead we slightly pivot the product in that direction and continue building. 

That's truly how you can build a startup in a week. With a core focus on foward momentum. 


## Don't pick the obvious problem

There are a million AI apps on the market right now that will take my blood, food, weight etc and then give me an AI printed sheet / plan. Its an obvious problem and something that my generation (gym rats) would love to use themselves. The challenge, is how do you make yourself unique. 

An AI assistant that calls me? Makes sure I get out of bed? eat? and do all the things that my brain screams "No" to?? That would be useful.

So I guess what I'm trying to say here is, don't pick something obvious. If you're into the gym and stuff great, but maybe basing your app on a real, value driven problem and result is whats going to make you a million bucks over $0. 

Heres 5 ideas that are interesting thought spaces right now for me:

1. How much IT work in Enterprise America could be automated by agents?
2. What new ways of education can we invent to speed up the process?
3. Whos making an AI to come up with personally tailored food and beverages?
4. How can I build a digital copy of myself and why would that be useful? 
5. If GPU cooling is cheaper in space - what else is cheaper to do in space?

## YOU HAVE GOT THIS

If theres anyone I am grateful to, its my co-founder Thomas. His American "you can do this" attitude helped me let go of some of my sabotaging self-beliefs. Stories I had gotten from growing up in the United Kingdom, where business and hustle culture is celebrated a lot less. 

So if I can say anything to get you hyped it would be:

- I worked for 6 years solo on $1500/m before my business blew up to the $10m its worth today.

- Things can change overnight. We went from doing one livestream to seeing an explosion in our growth $20,000 -> $1,000,000 in 7 months.

- It's okay to plan... but execution has so many learnings. Keep making stuff everyday.

## Onward plans

To continue teaching all my learnings from the last few years. Theres something so rewarding about sharing what we have learnt to the younger generation. After all theyll be the next wave of builders after us.
